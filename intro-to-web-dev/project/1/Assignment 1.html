                  <p>Dali was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images
                     in his surrealist work. HIs painterly skills are
                     often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters.
                     His best known work, <i>The Persistence of Memory</i>, was completed
                     in August 1931. Dali's expansive artistic repertoire included film,
                     sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.</p>
